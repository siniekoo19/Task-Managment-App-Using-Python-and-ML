## Project Structure
The project consists of two main folders: `task_manager.py` and `helper.py`.

- `task_manager.py`: This is the main code file that users will interact with directly.
- `helper.py`: This file contains the backend logic necessary for the functioning of the task manager.

### Process:
1. **User Authentication:** Users must log in to access the task manager. If it's their first time, they need to sign up.

2. **Task Management:** Once logged in, users can perform various actions on their task list, including adding, removing, or modifying tasks.

3. **Priority Suggestions:** Users have the option to receive priority suggestions for their tasks. They can either input a task description and receive a suggested priority or set the priority themselves.

4. **Task Recommendation:** Users can request recommendations for which tasks to prioritize based on the priority of each task.
